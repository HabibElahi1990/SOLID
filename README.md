# SOLID

This repository is about SOLID principles in java
   
* SOLID is one of the most popular sets of design principles in object-oriented software development. Itâ€™s a mnemonic acronym for the following five design principles:
    * Single Responsibility Principle
    * Open/Closed Principle
    * Liskov Substitution Principle
    * Interface Segregation Principle
    * Dependency Inversion Principle
    
 * Single Responsibility Principle 
    * Illustrate every class must have it's tasks 
    * we show the different when we use this principle and when we don't
    
 * Open/Closed Principle
    * Illustrate at least change after implementation
    * we show the different when we use this principle and when we don't in two package withoutUsePrinciple and withUsePrinciple
  
 * Liskov Substitution Principle
    * Illustrate that a subClasses should use all behaviors from superClass
    * we show contradiction of this principle
 
 * Interface Segregation Principle
    * Illustrate that when we use an interface we must use all of them it means we should not define a class and implement from an interface that don't need all or some method of that interface.
    * we show the different when we use this principle and when we don't in two package withoutUsePrinciple and withUsePrinciple
    
 * Dependency Inversion Principle
    * Illustrate high classed should not dependency low classes , it means by define.
    * we show the different when we use this principle and when we don't in two package withoutUsePrinciple and withUsePrinciple
